    'If you think of mining as drawing lottery balls out of an enormous bucket, you win Monero if you draw a number greater than 1,000, say. If you draw 100, you win nothing. By opting into merge mining Tari, you get an additional free ticket to win Tari if that number is greater than, say 90. If you draw 1,001 you win both Monero and Tari 🎁. If you draw 100, you don’t win Monero, but you still get your Tari. ',
